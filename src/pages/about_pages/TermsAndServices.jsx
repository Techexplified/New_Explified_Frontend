        <h3>SECTION 2 - TERMS FOR SUBSCRIBERS</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          This Section applies to all Subscribers and their Accounts
          (“Accounts”), which may also be referred to as “Subscriptions”.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Your Account</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          You agree to keep all of your Account information current (such as a
          change in billing address, card number, or expiration date), and you
          must promptly notify the Company if your payment method is canceled
          (including if you lose your card or it is stolen), or if you become
          aware of a potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized
          disclosure or use of your name or password). Changes to such
          information can be made on the Website. If you fail to provide us any
          of the foregoing information, you agree that you are responsible for
          fees accrued under your Account. In addition, you authorize us to
          obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for
          your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card
          issuer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You agree that all payments made on the Website are final, and you
          will not challenge or dispute the charge with your bank. You further
          agree that should you have any issues relating to your payment (such
          as duplicate billing), you will contact the Company to resolve the
          issue. Should a chargeback or dispute be initiated with your bank, you
          agree that you will be held responsible for any outstanding balance
          owed to us plus any chargeback fees charged by our bank, which may be
          as much as $60 CAD. You agree that you will pay any outstanding
          balance you have with the Company within 30 days from the date of
          notification. Any outstanding balance left unpaid after 30 days may be
          submitted to a collections agency, and you agree that a collections
          fee of up to 50% of the outstanding balance or $100 (whichever is
          higher) will be added to the amount that you owe.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to provide continuous service, the Company provides the
          option for automatic renewal. If the automatic renewal option or
          checkbox is selected during the payment process, we will automatically
          renew all paid Subscriptions on the date such Subscriptions expire.
          After your initial Subscription commitment period, and again after any
          subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically
          continue for an additional equivalent period. You acknowledge that
          your Account will be subject to these automatic renewals if you had
          selected the automatic renewal option. If you do not wish your Account
          to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your
          Subscription, please log in and go to “Account Settings” on the
          Website and follow the directions contained therein.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Company maintains a strict no-refund policy. All purchases made on
          the Website are final. If you choose to purchase a Subscription
          package on the Website, you agree that absolutely no refunds, either
          full or partial, will be issued for any reasons or for any unused or
          remaining Subscription. Further, you agree that no refunds will be
          made on any remaining or unused Subscription or credits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Subscriptions purchased are strictly non-transferable.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Company reserves the right to offer free Subscriptions to any
          person(s) of its choice at any given time, for any duration, while
          charging other Subscribers, at the same time. We also reserve the
          right to cancel the free trial period at any time, for all or any of
          its Subscribers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Upon registering as a Subscriber, you will choose a display name and
          password. You may not select or use a display name of another person
          (unless it is also your name), a name in violation of a third party’s
          property rights, or a display name that the Company deems offensive or
          otherwise inappropriate. The Company owns all display names and
          licenses them to you. We reserve the right to delete or alter any
          display name at any time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You are entirely liable for all activities conducted through your
          Account. A Subscriber may not permit another individual to use the
          Subscriber’s Account without direct supervision by the Subscriber.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Subscribers who have had their Account terminated may not access the
